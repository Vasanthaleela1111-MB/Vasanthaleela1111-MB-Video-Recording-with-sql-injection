# Vasanthaleela1111-MB-Video-Recording-with-sql-injection
This project uses Google Authenticator to generate a TOTP via QR scan. The frontend sends mobile, code, secret, and video URL to a backend API for verification. If correct, the video plays; if wrong, it alerts but still plays and returns a record_id. Backend must prevent SQL injection using validation and prepared statements.
